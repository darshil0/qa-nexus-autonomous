# User Walkthrough: QA Nexus Autonomous

Follow these steps to navigate the autonomous QA pipeline.

### 1. The Orchestrator (Input)
- **Manual Input:** Paste your requirements directly into the "Requirement Staging Area."
- **Jira Sync:** Enter a ticket ID (e.g., `AUTH-101`) and click **Sync** to pull live data from the simulated Jira service.
- **Launch:** Click **Launch Multi-Agent Pipeline** to trigger the sequence.

### 2. Requirement Inventory (Agent 1)
- Review the "Validated Specs" generated by Agent 1.
- Look for **Potential Gaps** (ambiguities) flagged in red.
- Click the **Map** icon or the **Trace** button to jump directly to the test scenarios covering that specific requirement.

### 3. Scenario Hub (Agent 2)
- Inspect the generated test cases.
- Use the **Search** bar to filter by category (Functional, Security, etc.).
- When tracing from a requirement, the relevant ID will be highlighted in indigo to maintain visual context.

### 4. Execution Stream (Agent 3)
- View real-time (simulated) logs.
- If a test fails, click **Report Defect** to generate a GitHub issue URL.
- Review STDOUT logs for detailed failure analysis.

### 5. Quality Dashboard (Insights)
- View high-level metrics:
  - **Traceability:** Percentage of requirements covered by tests.
  - **Stability:** Pass/Fail ratio of the current run.
  - **Saturation:** Distribution of test effort across the specification set.
